# Mastering the Node.js REPL

These are the examples for the "Mastering the Node.js REPL" article published in the [Trabe medium publication](https://medium.com/trabe).

The examples are divided in different files and the features are incrementally added for each section of the post. The examples use some ES6 features and they should be run with a node 8.9.0 (LTS) or higher.

You can run each example like this:

```
$ node repl-final.js
```

Or optionally, if you are using node 10 and you want to have `await` available inside the REPL:

```
$ node --experimental-repl-await repl-final.js
```
